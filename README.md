The six medals won by Chinese swimmer [Yufei Zhang](https://olympics.com/en/athletes/yufei-zhang) at the Paris 2024 Summer Olympic Games made her the most decorated athlete in the competition. However, **Zhang wasn't even in the top 50 of the athlete's medal table** because none of those medals were gold.

The top performer in Paris 2024 was [Leon Marchand](https://olympics.com/en/athletes/leon-marchand). The French swimmer clinched **four golds and a bronze medal**.

American [Torri Huske](https://olympics.com/en/athletes/torri-huske) and Australian [Mollie O'Callaghan](https://olympics.com/en/athletes/mollie-o-callaghan), swimmers, won three gold medals each. Huske added two silvers, while O'Callaghan clinched a silver and a bronze medal. 

One-third of the most decorated athletes in Paris 2024 were **swimmers**. Far behind were artistic gymnasts (9.8%), track and field athletes, sprint canoeists, and table tennis players among the athletes who won the most medals at the last Olympic Games.

Gymnast legend [Simone Biles](https://olympics.com/en/athletes/simone-biles) won three golds and a silver. Biles was **the best non-swimmer performer at the Games**. Her 11 Olympic medals confirm her as [the most decorated gymnast in history](https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/olympics/2024/08/01/simone-biles-olympic-medals-count/).

Besides Marchand and Biles, the three golds clinched by Dutch [Harrie Lavreysen](https://olympics.com/en/athletes/harrie-lavreysen) made him the most winning cyclist.
